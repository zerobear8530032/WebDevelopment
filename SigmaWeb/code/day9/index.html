    🎥 <video> Tag – Common Attributes
Attribute	Description
src	Path to the video file (e.g., .mp4, .webm, etc.)
controls	Displays the browser’s built-in playback controls (play, pause, volume, etc.)
autoplay	Starts playing the video automatically when the page loads (often requires muted)
muted	Mutes the audio; required for autoplay to work in most browsers
loop	Repeats the video automatically after it ends
poster	An image that shows before the video starts (like a thumbnail or preview image)
width / height	Sets the size of the video player (you can use just width, and height auto-scales)
preload	Tells the browser how much of the video to load when the page loads

🔍 What is preload?
The preload attribute gives a hint to the browser about whether the video should be loaded immediately when the page loads:

Value	Meaning
auto	Browser decides how much to load (default; usually starts loading metadata and some data)
metadata	Only loads video metadata (like duration, dimensions, etc.), not the video content
none	Browser shouldn't load anything until the user clicks "play"

🧠 Use Cases:
preload="none" if you want to save bandwidth (e.g., on mobile).

preload="metadata" if you just need duration, size, etc.

preload="auto" if you want the video to start faster when played. -->
