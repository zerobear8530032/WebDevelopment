<h1> Mark Up Language</h1>
<p>
    <hr>
    A <b>markup language</b> is a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encoding">text-encoding system </a>which specifies the structure and formatting of a document and potentially the relationships among its parts.[1] Markup can control the display of a document or enrich its content to facilitate automated processing.

    A markup language is a set of rules governing what markup information may be included in a document and how it is combined with the content of the document in a way to facilitate use by humans and computer programs. The idea and terminology evolved from the "marking up" of paper manuscripts (e.g., with revision instructions by editors), traditionally written with a red pen or blue pencil on authors' manuscripts.<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup>

    Older markup languages, which typically focus on typography and presentation, include Troff, TeX, and LaTeX. Scribe and most modern markup languages, such as XML, identify document components (for example headings, paragraphs, and tables), with the expectation that technology, such as stylesheets, will be used to apply formatting or other processing.
